in finding the right candidates.
To address this problem, the project aims to collect and analyze a large dataset of Data Science job postings on Glassdoor. The goal is to uncover trends,
patterns, and key factors influencing Data Science job postings, including job titles, required skills, experience levels, salary ranges.
